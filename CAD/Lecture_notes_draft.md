# Lecture - 

se have small project (ونش يدوي)
HOow will we siulate teh wire.


## Objective to construc the stiffness matrix

* Finite element is not to easy
* Validation: you have to validate the finite elemetn solution with the analyticla solution 
* Ho to valiate:
  * expermental 
  * sea someone who worked expermental and compare the results
  * search for domeone who worked on another case and work on it with the same startagiy you used.
  * work analytical


## notes (the lecture is very random)

* thw wires in the finite element can be acted as a force 
* what if there is welding 
* what is theere is bearings

## in ifnte elemetn
* we need to assume the displacement function 
*
