# Lecture 4 - Capacity Analysis

To plan for the capacity we need to do the folowing
* we need to no the volume of the demand in the market
  * by making sure there is a gap between the demand and the offer (من الغرف التجارية)
  * get to know statistics (CAPSCU)

Capacity :is the the `throuput` or the number of units a facility can produce in a period of time

uses of the capacity:
* determines the fixed costs (the machines to buy for example)
* to how much of the demand will be satisfied
* Three planning horizons (helps you to plan  for the far future(till 5 or 10 years) and short future (till two years) and opreational planning level (1 day to 3 month))

types of capacity:
* desing capapcity: the output capacity done by a machine (we might not be able to use it all because the setup time or maintense time)
* effiective capacity: 
  * it's the maximum output can be produced by the machine after considering the setup time and maintenece and oteher constrains 
  * always less then design capacity

## Utilization and Efficiency

Utilization: is the precent of design capacity realy achived, It indicates how much of the design capacity are used

$$utilization = \frac{actual output}{Design Capacity}$$

Efficiency is the precent of effictive capacity achieved  

$$Efficiency = \frac{actual output}{effective Capacity}$$


## Capacity plannning challenges

* inability to create a steady flow of demand to fully utilze capacity
* Demand Fluctuates and varies
* Idle capacity is a reality ( Prompt to chant gpt: what does this mean)

## Capacity Planning over a time horizon

* long range: (add facilites or new equipment)
* intermediaete range: (you can ask another partner to produce (subcontract), add more shifts)
* short range


## Demand 
### possible patterns
* growth
* decline
* cyclical 
* stable

### Case 1: Demand exceds capaicty
* Curtail demand by raisning prices for example
* long term solution to increase the capacity

### Case 2: Capacity exceeds demand
* Stimulate the market (like margeting)
* Product changes to fit the demand

### Case 3: adjusting seasonal deamnds
* Produce products with complimentary demand patterns (what does it mean)


## Capacity considerations

* forecast demand accurately
* understand the technology and capacity increments
* findd the optimal oprating level (volume)
* build for change (plann and know that the plan will change)

## Approadches to capacity expanstion

* Demand is leading the expanstion in the capacity
* the capacity leading the demand with one step expanstion
* Capacity lags demand but it increases (alwyas less then the demand but also works on being nearby it)
* increase the capacity over the demand and wait the demand to be more then the capacity then start increaseing the capacity again

## Decision Tree Analysis 

it conatains
* decision node (choise
* chance node (event)
* terminal node (consiquence): the result or outcom benfit or cost

Example:

There is 3 types of decistion taking
* risk
* conservitve
* rational (we use it)
